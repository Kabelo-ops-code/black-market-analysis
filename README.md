This project aims to uncover potential unreported or illicit trade flows between countries by analyzing asymmetries in bilateral trade data. Using statistical methods on trade data, the model identifies anomalies in export-import declarations and estimates potential black market economies.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Integration with UN Comtrade API
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering
- **Anomaly Detection**: Multiple statistical methods (Z-score, MAD, IQR)
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive charts and dashboards
- **Reporting**: Detailed analysis reports in multiple formats
